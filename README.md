# Isabelle's attempt at a terminal website

Hey! Good to see you here. 

My name is Isabelle (She/Her) and I am a third year student at the University of British Columbia studying Computer Science and Microbiology and Immunology.

Feel free to check out my resume for some of the work I've done, or shoot me an email at isabelle.y.tam@gmail.com

Hope to see you soon :)
